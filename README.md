# Sediment Transport Prediction in Steep Mountain Channels

This repository provides an experimental–machine learning framework
for predicting sediment transport in steep, boulder-dominated channels.

## Models Used
- Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)
- Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR)
- Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
- k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

## Features
- Time-resolved experimental dataset
- Streamlit-based GUI
- Model comparison and uncertainty estimation
- Ready for journal supplementary material

## Run the App
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
